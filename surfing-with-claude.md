This tutorial shows you how to use Claude Code with the Playwright MCP server to perform fully automated and intelligent web surfing directly from your terminal.

## What?

- Claude is a large language model from Anthropic. It's kinda like ChatGPT, but software developers like it more.
- Claude Code is Anthropic's official command-line interface for Claude. It's a chat interface that can read files, write files, write code, run commands, and more.
- Playwright is a browser automation tool that allows you to control a browser programmatically. Like driving Chrome or Safari with no hands!
- Playwright MCP is a server that allows you to use Playwright from Claude Code.
